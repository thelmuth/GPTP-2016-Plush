\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

Intro goes here. The overall story is that linear representations allows us to use clean uniform genetic operators and to get automatically hierarchical programs through automatic parentheses attached to specific instructions.



\section{Brief History of Push}



\section{Plush}



\section{Instruction-Based Hierarchy}

Here we talk about automatic parentheses.


\subsection{Experiment and Results}


\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Number of successes, out of 100 runs, using either Plush (which automatically adds parentheses after specific instructions) and a version of Plush in which automatic parenthesizing was turned off. In the latter, instructions were inserted into the instruction set that simply opened parentheses. THIS CAPTION IS NOT VERY GOOD.}

\section{Uniform Genetic Operators}

Here we talk about uniform genetic operators, and how tree-based operators do bad things. Heavy citation of the ULTRA paper \citep{Spector:2013:GPTP}.

Is uniform mutation most important?
